# 📱 Student Social Media Addiction Analysis

A data science project exploring the impact of social media usage on student health, sleep, and academic performance using clustering and predictive modeling techniques.

## 📌 Project Summary

This notebook analyzes a dataset of 700+ students from multiple countries to understand how social media behavior correlates with academic outcomes and well-being indicators. Through exploratory analysis, clustering (K-Means), and logistic regression modeling, we uncover key behavioral patterns and risk profiles.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Strong correlation between high usage and poor sleep/mental health.
- K-Means revealed 3 distinct student usage clusters (light, moderate, heavy).
- Logistic regression showed significant predictors of academic impact (e.g., sleep hours, platform time).
- ROC-AUC of ~0.80 indicated solid predictive performance.
